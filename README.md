CIS195-201 Final Project (PennKey: AndrewYu)

A to-do list app that tracks how long it takes you to complete a task; just tap the play button on an app to start tracking!

Goals:
* Create a working login / logout system to handle different users [Buggy]
* Add multiple tasks to the list [...can't handle clearing lists when switching between users]
* Track how much time you spend on a task [KIND OF WORKS]
* Track how many tasks you completed [INCOMPLETE]
* Visualize how much time you spend on your tasks [INCOMPLET E]

Instructions for Running Project:
- Log in
- In the Plan & Track tab, you can add tasks and timetrack the tasks (you can timetrack multiple tasks, as well)
- Add tasks by hitting the add button! Right now, you can set the name, due date, and the priority level
- Want to timetrack? Hit the play button on a given task, and it'll start counting away by the second! You can pause, and it'll still keep track :D. Still figuring out a way to keep the tracking, though.
- Reflect tab: it's in the works! Come back later...
