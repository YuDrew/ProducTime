CIS195-201 Final Project (PennKey: AndrewYu)

A to-do list app that tracks how long it takes you to complete a task; just tap the play button on an app to start tracking!

Goals:
* Create a working login / logout system to handle different users [Buggy]
* Add multiple tasks to the list [...can't handle clearing lists when switching between users]
* Track how much time you spend on a task [KIND OF WORKS]
* Track how many tasks you completed [INCOMPLETE]
* Visualize how much time you spend on your tasks [INCOMPLETE]

Instructions for Running Project:
- Log in
- In the Plan & Track tab, you can add tasks and timetrack the tasks (you can timetrack multiple tasks, as well)
- You can start timing a task by hitting the "play" button on a given task
- To see how long you've been on the task, hit that button again, click away (e.g. move to the reflect page and then move back), and then come back (I couldn't figure out how to get the images to reload with state).
